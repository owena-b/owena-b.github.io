        <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Welcome! I'm a journalist (with an emphasis on data) from St. Louis, based in Washington, D.C.</p>
            <p>I study journalism and data science at American University in D.C. I'm an investigative reporter for The Eagle, the school’s student newspaper, where I previously covered local news and student government.</p>
            <p>This website, I hope, will be my personal “morgue” for my projects, no matter whether they're written in English or code.</p>
            <p>Below, you’ll see places I’ve written on staff and projects I’ve done on my own. Please use the data and code below if they will help you; all I ask is that you give credit where appropriate.</p>
